# Homebrew cask for LiteNotch. LiteNotch's release workflow
# (tangnatta/LiteNotch, .github/workflows/release.yml) rewrites `version` and `sha256` for every
# tagged release, so edit the rest by hand and leave those two to CI.

  caveats <<~EOS
    LiteNotch is not notarized yet. The cask removes the quarantine flag so it
    can open; if you prefer, build it from source instead (see the README).

    To show Claude Code approvals in the notch:
      litenotch hooks install
  EOS
